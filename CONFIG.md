# Configuration

the configuration format, with defaults, is documented below:

```toml
title = "bingus-blog"  # title of the blog
# description of the blog
description = "blazingly fast blog software written in rust memory safe"
raw_access = true      # allow users to see the raw source of a post
js_enable = true       # enable javascript (required for sorting and dates)
engine = "markdown"    # choose which post engine to use
                       # options: "markdown", "blag"
                       # absolutely do not use "blag" unless you know exactly
                       # what you are getting yourself into.

[style]
date_format = "RFC3339" # format string used to format dates in the backend
                       # it's highly recommended to leave this as default,
                       # so the date can be formatted by the browser.
                       # format: https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html#specifiers
default_sort = "date"  # default sorting method ("date" or "name")
#default_color = "#f5c2e7" # default embed color, optional

[style.display_dates]
creation = true        # display creation ("written") dates
modification = true    # display modified ("last modified") dates

[rss]
enable = false         # serve an rss field under /feed.xml
                       # this may be a bit resource intensive
link = "https://..."   # public url of the blog, required if rss is enabled

[dirs]
posts = "posts"        # where posts are stored
media = "media"        # directory served under /media/
custom_templates = "templates" # custom templates dir
custom_static = "static"       # custom static dir
                       # see CUSTOM.md for documentation
[http]
host = "::"            # ip to listen on
port = 3000            # port to listen on

[cache]
enable = true          # save metadata and rendered posts into RAM
                       # highly recommended, only turn off if absolutely necessary
cleanup = true         # clean cache, highly recommended
#cleanup_interval = 86400000 # clean the cache regularly instead of just at startup
                       # uncomment to enable
persistence = true     # save the cache to on shutdown and load on startup
file = "cache"         # file to save the cache to
compress = true        # compress the cache file
compression_level = 3  # zstd compression level, 3 is recommended

[render]
escape = false         # escape HTML in the markdown soucre instead of
                       # clobbering it (https://docs.rs/comrak/latest/comrak/struct.RenderOptions.html#structfield.escape)
unsafe = false         # allow HTML and dangerous links (https://docs.rs/comrak/latest/comrak/struct.RenderOptions.html#structfield.unsafe_)

[render.syntect]
load_defaults = false   # include default syntect themes
themes_dir = "themes"   # directory to include themes from
theme = "Catppuccin Mocha" # theme file name (without `.tmTheme`)

[blag]
bin = "blag"           # path to blag binary
```

configuration is done in [TOML](https://toml.io/)  
if an option marked "optional" is not set, it will not be initialized with
a default value  
you don't have to copy the whole thing from here,  
it's generated by the program if it doesn't exist

## Specifying the configuration file

the configuration file is loaded from `config.toml` by default, but the path
can be overriden by setting the environment variable `BINGUS_BLOG_CONFIG`,
which will make bingus-blog try to read that file or fail and exit.
